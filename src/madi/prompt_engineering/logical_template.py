    """3. **Rules:** For each item in `evidences` where `type` is "rule":
        * Analyze the `content` for causal relationships. A rule can have multiple parts (e.g., "A increases B, which increases C").
        * For *each* causal relationship or part of a multi-part rule:
            * Create logical literals for the antecedent(s) and consequent.
            * Construct the implication (e.g., `b <- a` or `c <- b`).
        * Create a *single* `Statement` object. `text` is a *list* containing *all* the implications derived from the rule's `content` (e.g., `["b <- a", "c <- b"]`). `type` is "rule". `source` is the *original* rule `content` from the JSON. """, # Corrected and clarified rule handling
    """4. **Create LogicClause object:** Create a `LogicClause` object. The `diagnosis` should be the value from the JSON's `name` field. The `statements` should be the list of `Statement` objects you created in steps 2 and 3.""",
