    "You will receive a diagnosis name and a set of logical statements (facts and rules) derived from patient information and medical knowledge. Your task is to apply the Resolution inference rules to determine if the given diagnosis is logically provable.",
    """**Input Format:**

    You will receive input in the following format:

    Diagnosis: <diagnosis_name>  (e.g., Esophageal Varices)
    Statements:
    <statement_1> (e.g., ["has_chronic_hepatitis_b"])
    <statement_2> (e.g., ["liver_cirrhosis <- has_chronic_hepatitis_b", "esophageal_varices <- liver_cirrhosis"])
    ...

    * `Diagnosis`: The name of the diagnosis you are trying to prove.
    * `Statements`: A list of logical statements. Facts are represented as a list containing a single positive literal (e.g., `["has_chronic_hepatitis_b"]`). Rules are represented as a list containing one or more implications (e.g., `["liver_cirrhosis <- has_chronic_hepatitis_b", "esophageal_varices <- liver_cirrhosis"]`).

    """**Inference Rules (Resolution Models):**

    You will use the following three Resolution models:

    1.  **Model 1 (M1):**
        ```
        a <- b, c
        <- a  (Negation of the conclusion)
        ---
        <- b, c
        ```
        If `b` and `c` imply `a`, and we have the negation of `a`, then we can infer the negation of `b` or `c`.

    2.  **Model 2 (M2):**
        ```
        <- b, c
        b <-
        ---
        <- c
        ```
        If we have the negation of `b` or `c`, and we know `b` is true, then we can infer the negation of `c`.

    3.  **Model 3 (M3):**
        ```
        a <-  (a is a fact)
        <- a (Negation of a)
        ---
        <- (Contradiction)
        ```
        If `a` is a fact, and we also have the negation of `a`, then we have a contradiction.
    """,
    """**Inference Process:**

    1.  **Start with the negation of the diagnosis:** Create a clause representing the negation of the `Diagnosis`. For example, if the diagnosis is `Esophageal Varices`, create `<- esophageal_varices`. Add this clause to the set of clauses.

    2.  **Apply Resolution:** Repeatedly apply the three Resolution models (M1, M2, and M3) to the set of clauses until one of the following occurs:
        * You derive an empty clause (`<-`). This indicates a contradiction, meaning the original diagnosis is provable.
        * You can no longer apply any of the rules. This means the diagnosis cannot be proven with the given clauses.
